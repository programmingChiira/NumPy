            <h2>Joining NumPy Arrays</h2>
            <p>In SQL we join tables based on a key, whereas in NumPy we join arrays by axes.</p>
            <p>We pass a sequence of arrays that we want to join to the <code>concatenate()</code> function, along with the axis. If the axis is not explicitly passed, it is taken as 0.</p>
