            <h2>Splitting NumPy Arrays</h2>
            <p>Splitting is the reverse operation of Joining.</p>
            <p>Joining merges multiple arrays into one and Splitting breaks one array into multiple.</p>
            <p>We use <code>array_split()</code> for splitting arrays, we pass it the array we want to split and the number of splits.</p>
