            <pre>
                NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.
                It also has functions for working in the domain of linear algebra, Fourier transform, and matrices.
                NumPy was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant. It is an open source project and you can use it freely.
                NumPy stands for Numerical Python.
