            <h2>Iterating Arrays</h2>
            <p>Iterating means going through elements one by one.</p>
            <p>As we deal with multi-dimensional arrays in Numpy, we can do this using a basic <code>for</code> loop of Python.</p>
            <p>If we iterate on a 1-D array it will go through each element one by one.</p>
