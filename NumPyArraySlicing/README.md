            <h2>Slicing arrays</h2>
            <p>Slicing in Python means taking elements from one given index to another given index.</p>
            <p>We pass a slice instead of an index like this: <code>[start: end]</code>.</p>
            <p>We can also define the step, like this: <code>[start:end:step]</code>.</p>
            <p>If we don't pass start it's considered 0.</p>
            <p>If we don't pass the end it's considered to be the length of the array in that dimension.</p>
            <p>If we don't pass a step it's considered 1.</p>
